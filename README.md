# HabitTrack
Little TKinter habit tracker

The hope here is to create a little habit tracking window with tkinter, where it creates/checks for a tracking.json file in the current directory. It then has a setting to check if it's a positive habit or a negative habit and displays:
- days remaining in goal
- days needed to meet goal
- habit title
- percentage success so far
- goal success percentage
